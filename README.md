# Minesweeper
Minesweeper - A complex and stegic video game.

**Minesweeper Rules**
- Board Layout: The game board is a grid composed of cells arranged in rows and columns. Some cells contain mines (bombs), while others are empty.
- Cell States: Each cell on the board can have three states:
- Covered: The cell is hidden and has not been revealed yet.
- Revealed: The cell has been clicked and its contents (mine or number) are visible.
- Flagged: The player can mark a cell they believe contains a mine with a flag.
- Numbers: When an empty cell is revealed, it may display a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it. This number can range from 0 to 8, depending on the number of neighboring cells that contain mines.
- Winning the Game: The player wins the game by revealing all the empty cells without detonating any mines.
- Losing the Game: The player loses the game if they reveal a cell containing a mine.
- Controls:
- Reveal a Cell: The player clicks on a covered cell to reveal it.
- Flag a Cell: The player can mark a covered cell with a flag if they suspect it contains a mine.
- Adjacent Cells: Each cell is surrounded by up to 8 adjacent cells (diagonal, horizontal, and vertical neighbors).
- Flagging Mines: Flagging a cell can help the player keep track of potential mines, but it doesn't affect the gameplay outcome directly.
- Time and Scores: The game may track the time taken to complete the game and/or the number of moves made, which can be used to compare scores with other players.
- Restart: Players can restart the game at any time if they lose or want to try again.
